## R Markdown
 
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
You need a working pandoc installation on your computer (this should be taken care of if you have an RStudio installation)


```{r load_data_and_packages, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (file.exists("../_targets")) {
  targets::tar_config_set("store" = "../_targets")
  }
targets::tar_load(summary_data)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Road casualty data

We can present a visual display of the number of road casualties as follows:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
summary_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = casualty_severity, y = Casualties, 
             fill = casualty_severity)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab("Severity of Casualty") + 
  ylab("Number of reported and sub-sampled casualties") + 
  labs(title = "Number of reported pedestrian road casualties in 2023",
       subtitle = "All fatalities, 10% of serious and 1% of slight casualties",
       caption = "Source: STATs19, data.gov.uk")
```

Do note that there has been a lot of sub-sampling. All fatally injured road pedestrian casualties are included in the data, but 10% of serious and 1% of slight casualties were selected at random.
